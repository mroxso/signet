- Auto-approved requests now logged and visible in Activity feed
- All NIP-46 events (sign_event, nip04/nip44 encrypt/decrypt) now appear in Activity
- Denied requests tracked and visible in Activity feed with dedicated Denied tab

- SSE events for app revoke/update and key rename/passphrase changes
- SSE connection reliability: heartbeat monitoring, page visibility handling, network status awareness, automatic state refresh on reconnection

### Changed
- CSRF protection now skipped for Bearer token authentication (API clients using `Authorization: Bearer` header no longer need CSRF tokens)
- Complete UI redesign with dark theme and sidebar navigation
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Connect flow now always requires manual approval with trust level selection
- Simplified trust level labels: "Always Ask", "Auto-approve Safe", "Auto-approve All"
- User-friendly method labels throughout UI (e.g., "Sign a note" instead of "sign_event")
- Activity page tabs reorganized: "All" (default), "Approved", "Denied", "Expired" (removed "Pending" since Home handles it)
- Switched Docker images from node:20-alpine to node:20-slim to avoid building better-sqlite3 from source on image rebuids.
- Updated all documentation to reflect current state of backend and frontend
- SSE keep-alive interval reduced from 30s to 15s for better proxy compatibility

### Removed
- OAuth account creation flow
- NDK dependency (replaced with nostr-tools)
- Auto-refresh settings (SSE handles all real-time updates)

### Fixed
- Relay subscriptions now recover after system sleep/wake
- Pending count excludes expired requests
- Various race conditions and error handling improvements
- All approved requests now logged to Activity (not just trust-level auto-approvals)
- Trust level changes now properly enforced: downgrading from "full" removes explicit permissions that would bypass trust level checks

### Security
- JWT authentication required for all sensitive endpoints
- Upgraded to AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 (600k iterations)
- CSRF protection, rate limiting, timing-safe comparisons
