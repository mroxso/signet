## [1.7.0]

### Added
- **NIP-49 encryption support**: Industry-standard key encryption using XChaCha20-Poly1305 with scrypt KDF
  - New keys can be encrypted with NIP-49 (recommended) or legacy AES-256-GCM format
  - Import existing `ncryptsec` keys directly without re-encryption
  - Interactive encryption format selection during key creation (web UI and CLI)
- **Key export functionality**: Export keys for backup or migration
  - Choose between NIP-49 (ncryptsec) or plaintext (nsec) format
  - Downloads as a text file with key name, npub, and secret
  - Requires passphrase verification for encrypted keys
- **Key encryption migration**: Upgrade existing keys from legacy to NIP-49 encryption
  - "Migrate to NIP-49" option in key details for legacy-encrypted keys
  - Requires current passphrase and new passphrase confirmation
  - Logged as `key_migrated` admin event for audit trail
- **CLI encryption flags**: Non-interactive key management
  - `signet add --nip49`: Use NIP-49 encryption (recommended)
  - `signet add --legacy`: Use legacy AES-256-GCM encryption
  - `signet add --no-encrypt`: Store key unencrypted (not recommended)
  - Interactive prompt when no flag specified (defaults to NIP-49)
- **New admin event types**: Extended activity tracking
  - `key_encrypted`: Key encryption applied during creation
  - `key_migrated`: Key encryption migrated to NIP-49
  - `key_exported`: Key exported (ncryptsec or nsec)
  - `auth_failed`: Authentication failure
  - `panic_triggered`: Dead man switch panic triggered
  - `deadman_reset`: Inactivity timer reset
- **NIP-49 unit tests**: Spec test vector verification for encryption/decryption
- **Health endpoint: Log buffer stats**: `/health` now includes log buffer memory usage
  - Shows entries count, max capacity, and estimated memory in KB
  - Helps monitor in-memory log buffer overhead

### Improved
- **Web UI: Key details redesign**
  - Connected Apps section now collapsible with count badge (replaces "Show X more" pattern)
  - Export section uses expandable label pattern (cleaner than separate label + button)
  - Removed redundant "Online"/"Locked" text badges (status dot is sufficient)
- **Web UI: Sidebar + button** now opens create key form and navigates to Keys page
- **Human-readable admin event labels**: All admin events now display user-friendly text
  - `key_migrated` → "Encryption migrated"
  - `key_exported` → "Key exported"
  - `panic_triggered` → "Panic triggered"
  - `deadman_reset` → "Inactivity timer reset"
- **Android: Admin event labels** updated to match web UI
- **Web UI: Real-time system status** via SSE (no polling)
  - Backend emits `health:updated` every 10 seconds for metrics (memory, uptime)
  - Key operations (unlock, lock, create, delete) emit health updates instantly
  - ~50% less bandwidth than polling (SSE messages vs HTTP requests)
  - Initial fetch on page load, then SSE-only

### Fixed
- **Key export**: Fixed response format mismatch causing export button to appear non-functional
- **Import ncryptsec**: Fixed incorrect passphrase confirmation requirement when importing already-encrypted keys
- **Delete unlocked key**: Fixed "passphrase required" error when deleting an already-unlocked encrypted key
- **Memory leak: Rate limit store**: Replaced unbounded Map with TTLCache
  - Under high traffic, the rate limit store could grow indefinitely since cleanup only ran every 60s
  - Now uses TTLCache with 10,000 max entries, automatic cleanup every 30s, and LRU eviction
  - TTL set to block duration + window to ensure blocked entries persist appropriately

### Dependencies
- **nostr-tools**: Upgraded from 2.17.0 to 2.19.4 for bug fixes and memory improvements

---

## [1.6.2]

### Fixed
- **Daemon: Memory leak in AdminCommandService reconnection timers**
  - Reconnection `setTimeout` calls were not tracked or cleared during refresh/shutdown
  - Closures in timers held references to relay URLs, filters, and generation counters
  - Added `reconnectTimers` Set to track pending timers, cleared on `closeAllWebsockets()`
  - Added exponential backoff with max 10 retries per relay
  - Retry counts reset on successful connection

- **Daemon: Memory leak in AdminCommandService publishEvent**
  - WebSockets created for publishing confirmation DMs were not cleaned up after `Promise.any()` resolved
  - Orphaned sockets and their timeouts accumulated when publishing to multiple relays
  - Added try/finally cleanup that closes all WebSockets and clears timeouts after publish completes

- **Daemon: Memory leak in ACL cache**
  - Manual Map-based cache only cleaned expired entries on access
  - Entries that were never re-accessed persisted until max size forced eviction
  - Migrated to `TTLCache` with automatic background cleanup every 60 seconds
  - Provides proper LRU eviction and stats via `getAllCacheStats()`

---

## [1.6.1]

### Fixed
- **Android: Biometric unlock button unresponsive after cancellation** ([#39](https://github.com/Letdown2491/signet/issues/39))
  - Pressing "Unlock" after dismissing the biometric prompt did nothing
  - Changed from boolean flag to counter so each button press triggers a new prompt
- **Android: Force-close bypassed app lock requirement** ([#39](https://github.com/Letdown2491/signet/issues/39))
  - App lock was incorrectly bypassed when force-closing and reopening the app
  - Now persists last activity timestamp to survive app restarts
  - Timeout setting (immediately, 1 min, 5 min, 15 min) now works correctly for both backgrounding and closing the app
- **Daemon: Memory leak in AdminCommandService (kill switch)**
  - WebSocket event listeners were not removed when connections closed during refresh cycles
  - Each refresh created new connections with 4 event handlers that kept references to captured variables
  - Added `ws.removeAllListeners()` before closing WebSockets to properly release memory
  - Reduced `processedEventIds` cache TTL from 24 hours to 1 hour to limit memory usage
- **Daemon: Memory leak in SSE event handlers**
  - Event listeners registered on request/response objects were never removed after cleanup
  - Refactored to use named handler functions that are explicitly removed with `.off()` on disconnect
  - Prevents closure accumulation when SSE clients reconnect

---

## [1.3.0]

- OAuth account creation flow
- NDK dependency (replaced with nostr-tools)
- Auto-refresh settings (SSE handles all real-time updates)

### Fixed
- Relay subscriptions now recover after system sleep/wake
- Pending count excludes expired requests
- Various race conditions and error handling improvements
- All approved requests now logged to Activity (not just trust-level auto-approvals)
- Trust level changes now properly enforced: downgrading from "full" removes explicit permissions that would bypass trust level checks

### Security
- JWT authentication required for all sensitive endpoints
- Upgraded to AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 (600k iterations)
- CSRF protection, rate limiting, timing-safe comparisons

### Added
